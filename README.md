# HELLO! Welcome to BreakTheCycle
> We have all had that moment where we throw something away and think, "I probably should have recycled that." Welcome to BreakTheCycle, an app designed to help you know when and how to recycle everyday items! Have a question about a specific item you want to recycle? Enter it into the search bar to access our recyclable item database, packed with up-to-date information on recycling best practice!

## Getting Started
Get started by cloning or downloading this repo onto you local machine, and then download the necessary npm modules by running "npmi i" and the name of the module. 

Modules used: 'express' 'render' 'body-parser'

## Running the App
Once you have all of the dependencies installed, you can run the server by typing "node app.js" in your terminal to get started. Then visit http://localhost:5000 to try it out.

## Stopping the App
You can stop the app and server from running by typing "Cntrl + C" on your keyboard in the terminal where you started the app.
